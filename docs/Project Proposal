Primary Idea:
Our application will essentially be a travel aid. We will use data from sites such as hotels.com, Airbnb, Hertz, Zipcar, and Google flight 
search to provide information about the best deals on places to stay and modes of transportation in/to the user’s destination of choice. 
We will also pull data from the user’s Facebook or Instagram account in order to generate a list of places they might be interested in 
visiting within the city/region they are visiting. We will use TripAdvisor to pick the highest rated locations and to provide information 
on entry fees, etc. Additionally, we will tell the user what form of transportation will be the least expensive and most convenient for 
travelling to the attractions we’ve gathered for them (such as ride-sharing, rental bikes, or the metro/bus). We will use the user’s 
Google login information as our third-party authenticator. Users will be required to create a profile within the application. 


Secondary Idea:
This application is intended to be a shopping aid. Users will enter a specific product or product category they wish to receive 
information on. Pulling data from shopping sites, such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart and BestBuy, for various products, our application 
generates the product listing with the lowest overall price, including shipping, either for each individual site or across all platforms. 
The app will also track users’ purchase history and use that data to generate recommendations on products they may wish to buy in the 
future. We will employ the user’s Google login as the form of third party authentication. Users will be required to create a profile 
within the application.
