After logging in and entering the new destination (refer to user story 1 and 2), the application will display the route to the entered 
destination. It will choose a route based on the traffic and preferred method of transportation, resulting in the most efficient path to 
the destination. For example, if there is an accident on the highway and the method of transportation is a car, the car will be rerouted 
to use local roads. Regarding the methods of transportation, the application will support car, biking, walking, and the various methods 
of public transportation. Private transportation such as Uber or Lyft will not be supported due to their own system determining the route.
