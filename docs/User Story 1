When a user first accesses our site they will be able to press a button on the homepage that will take them to a separate “log-in” 
page (users may also use our application without logging in, however, they will be unable to access personalized features or 
recommendations -- they will have to enter all search information manually). On this page they will have the option either 
to log into their preexisting account or to create a new account. Users will log in using either their Facebook credentials -- 
if they are a new user they will be prompted to link their account. Once users have logged in, our app will return them to the 
homepage and provide them with recommendations based on their user profiles and information pulled from their Facebook. New users 
will be brought to a “create profile” page where they will be required to enter basic information about themselves (name, location, 
email, etc.) along with their destination preferences. Once they have saved their info they will be returned to our homepage.
