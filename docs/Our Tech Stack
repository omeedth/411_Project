We are using MongoDB, Express, REACT, and NodeJS. We chose this technology stack because we think it works best for web-based 
applications, especially since NodeJS and MongoDB mesh together very well. We also considered using Python with Flask and MySQL 
for the database, but we figured those would be much messier to integrate.
