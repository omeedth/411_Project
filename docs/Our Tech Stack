We are using Cloud Firestore, Express, REACT, and NodeJS (a slight modification of the MERN stack). We chose this technology stack because we think it works best for web-based applications, especially since NodeJS and MongoDB mesh together very well. REACT is being used for the  front end because we wanted to learn a new front end application. We originally wanted to use MongoDB but eventually decided to use Cloud Firestore instead. No one on our team had any experience with MongoDB so integrating it into our app was going to be difficult. Firestore, a Google product, came with clear instructions and was very easy to work with. We also considered using Python with Flask and MySQL for the database, but we figured those would be much messier to integrate. This is because MySQL is used for more enterprise related websites/databases. We also decided against Flask because when we thought about web applications JavaScript was the first thing to come to mind, and not Python/Flask.
