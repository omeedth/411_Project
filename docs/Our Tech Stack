We are using MongoDB, Express, REACT, and NodeJS (MERN stack). We chose this technology stack because we think it works best for web-based 
applications, especially since NodeJS and MongoDB mesh together very well. REACT is being used for the front end because we wanted to learn
a new front end application. We also considered using Python with Flask and MySQL for the database, but we figured those would be much messier to integrate.
This is because MySQL is used for more enterprise related websites/databases. We also decided against Flask because when we thought about web 
applications JavaScript was the first thing to come to mind, and not Python/Flask.
