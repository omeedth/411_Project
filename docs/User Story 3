When a user accesses our site, logged in or not, they will see a second search bar with one field (below the one described in User 
Story 2): Address. The user will enter a cityâ€™s name into the box and click the submit button. This will tell our app to hit the Yelp API 
and get data on the tourist attractions in the specified city. We will display this data to the user.
