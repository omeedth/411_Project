When entering a new destination, a user may enter a city or zipcode to search for their destination. If the location they have searched 
for is invalid (does not exist as a location due to spelling error or does not refer to a location by zipcode), it will return that their 
search returned no matches and to try again. If they are logged in (user story 1), users should be able to see their previous searches as 
they are typing and locations of interest that they have bookmarked or “saved for later” earlier. If there are multiple locations 
corresponding to the name they have typed, all those locations should be returned as a search result for the user to select.
