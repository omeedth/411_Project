When a user accesses our site, logged in or not, they will see a search bar with three fields: Start Location, End Location, and 
Start Date. The user will enter information into each box and click the submit button. This will tell our app to hit the Amadeus API
and get flight data for the specified journey. We will display this data to the user.
